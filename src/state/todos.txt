Mobile Command strip ideas

Strip should probably be incorporated into the lower ribbon.
Left arrow and right arrow at positions of thumbs to change current section.
Duplicate of section is shown between the buttons. Above this strip is the resume, taking up a smaller portion of the screen - primarily just there to show an outline around active section
I think all UI buttons should exist in the command strip as well, with one possible exception being the dropdown, which might need a different approach for mobile
